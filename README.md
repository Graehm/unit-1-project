# Tic Tac Toe!
Traditionally played on a 3x3 grid, players take turns to connect rows of 3 while strategically positioning themselves on the board to prevent their opponent from completing a row of 3. 

Tic tac toe is traced back to Egypt and the Roman Empire. Both made use of the 3x3 grid and the game rules. However, some expanded Tic Tac Toe to grid sizes much larger than then common 3x3 grid. Further differences in the game were the markers used. For instance, Egypt is known for using roof tiles, while the Romans are known for using pebbles. The things we associate with Tic Tac Toe -- the name itself, our X & O markers as well as the 3x3 grid are our modern interpretation. 

Coincidently, Tic Tac Toe was one of the first video games (1952), and this is my first ever computer program.

## Next Steps/Icebox Items
Next steps will be adding player descriptions to the best of 5 functionality and its scoring. From there, I want to take the game to the next level by adding a play-the-computer mode. Looking into expanding the grid to a 4x4 or 5x5 based on level.
