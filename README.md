# Tic Tac Toe!
Played on a 3x3 grid, players take turns to connect rows of 3 while strategically positioning themselves on the board to prevent their opponent from completing a row of 3. 

Tic tac toe is traced back to Egypt and the Roman Empire. Both made use of the 3x3 grid and the game rules. However, the name of the game and the markers used varied based on location. Egypt is known for using roof tiles, and the Romans using pebbles. The X's and O's and even the name "Tic Tac Toe" that we are familaier today are a modern interpretation of the ancient game. Coincidently, Tic Tac Toe was one of the first video games (1952), and this is my first ever computer program.

## Next Steps/Icebox Items
I hope to add sound effects to the game board, and winning message. Additionally, I'd like to add an AI feature making the game single player.
